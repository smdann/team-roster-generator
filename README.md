## Description

The Team Roster Generator is a command-line application that prompts the user to enter information about each team member. A series of prompts collect information about the manager, engineer(s), and intern(s). After collecting information about each team member, it creates a nicely formatted team roster in the form of an HTML file.

## Installation 

This application uses npm Inquirer 8.2.4, fs, and Jest. Inquirer allows for the gathering of information from the user via command-line prompts and fs allows for the writing of the HTML file. The Jest package is used for testing. Please run 'npm i' to install the required packages for this application.

## Usage 

Use of this application provides the user with the ability to easily create a roster for their team.

First, download the required packages by running 'npm i'.

* This will install the packages needed to initiate the prompts for entering your team member information, as well as other essential packages.

By entering 'node index' in the command-line, the application will be invoked.

* A series of prompts will allow the user to enter information about the team manger.

* The user will then have the ability to add more team members by selecting their role, and adding information via prompts.

* Additional team members can be added until all members of the team have been accounted for.

Once complete, a dynamically created HTML file will be written to the ./dist folder.

* Opening the file will show a nicely formatted webpage with cards for each team member.

* The cards will list the employee name, title, ID, and email address. The email address link will open the user's default email program and populate the email address in the 'to' field.

* Additionally, the card for the manager will display an office number. 

* The engineer card will have a GitHub username, which links to a GitHub profile. 

* The intern card will have a school name.
